### "If the University Library is an Abbey, then I am the Abbot."
- 🌀💻 I am studying Applied Mathematics and Modelling in the Master CSMI of the University of Strasbourg.
- 🧬🌱 I have graduated the Double Bachelor in Mathematics and Biology of the Paris-Saclay University.
- 🐍 I love starting funny projects around Biomathematics, Videogames or Music and never ending them.
